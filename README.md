In this assignment I was tasted with creating a simple webpage that showed I knew how to create nav bar, a table, a simple form, and have images show on a webpage. While creating this page I used code such as fieldset to make sure everything in my contact section stayed nice and tight together and aligned, I used the table to create a table that showed product name, price, quantity, and total. The nav bar jumps to each section of the project with no issue, and all buttons function.
